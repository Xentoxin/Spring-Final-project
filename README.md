Konstantinovich Period 9 Spring Final Project
First Person Pong
  Our final project is a first person take on the original pong game. In this program you look down a corridor. The ball bounces around the corridor from the middle to the front wall (you) back to the back wall. To hit the ball, left click the mouse to summon a paddle. Everytime you hit the ball with the paddle you gain a point which is shown on the top left corner. A sound is also played everytime you hit the ball. The ball gradually accelerates in speed. There is no end. But once you miss the ball, then it just restarts from the center. Everything resets including the score and ball speed. 


Instructions: Start the program. Left click to create paddle to deflect the ball. Keep going for as long as possible.
